# Number-Guessing-Game
Created as part of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code challenge.  This challenge was to work with variable scopes.  My answer was not as good as Angela's solution, but it is my own honest attempt and I continue to learn and understand the best way to compartmentalize functions and create optimal program flow.
